# Python Problem Set: Foundational Programming Exercises

This repository contains solutions to a collection of beginner-to-intermediate Python programming exercises. The problems cover a wide range of topics, including functions, recursion, object-oriented programming, file I/O, HTML parsing, web scraping, SQL, and list comprehensions. This notebook serves as a comprehensive practice resource for learners who want to build a strong foundation in Python programming and basic data handling.

## Repository Contents

- **`problemset2.ipynb`**  
  A Jupyter notebook with code-based solutions to several programming questions. Key topics include:
  - Function definitions and use of global variables
  - Reading files with error handling
  - Class creation and inheritance
  - The Collatz sequence and recursion
  - Parsing HTML using `HTMLParser`
  - Basic web scraping using `BeautifulSoup` and `urllib`
  - SQL query writing for typical data extraction tasks
  - List comprehensions and data transformation

- **`bloodtype1.txt`**  
  A sample text file used in Question 2 to demonstrate file handling and exception management.

- **`w3c.html`**  
  A static HTML file used in Question 6 for parsing headings with a custom parser.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.x and the following libraries installed:

- `beautifulsoup4`
- `urllib` (part of Pythonâ€™s standard library)
- `html.parser` (built-in)

To install required packages, run:

```bash
pip install beautifulsoup4
```

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

2. Open the notebook using Jupyter:

```bash
jupyter notebook problemset2.ipynb
```

3. Run and explore each section of the notebook to deepen your understanding of core Python programming concepts.

## Notes

- SQL queries assume a table named `weather` with columns such as `City`, `Country`, `Season`, `Temperature`, and `Rainfall`.
- Ensure internet access is available when running web scraping code that fetches content from live websites.
- All examples are written in Python 3.

## Learning Objectives

By working through the notebook, you will:

- Strengthen your Python coding fundamentals
- Understand how to structure and inherit classes
- Learn to parse and analyze text and HTML content
- Apply recursion and file handling techniques
- Practice real-world data querying with SQL
- Gain confidence using Python's list comprehensions for efficient coding
